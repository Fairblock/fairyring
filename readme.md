# Overview

**fairyring** abstracts away intensive cryptographic operations for applications built within its chain as well as those built on alternative blockchains.

## Quick Start

To learn how the Fairyring works from a high-level perspective, see the [Fairyring Basic Docs](https://docs.fairblock.network/).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to integrate Fairyring to your own app-chain, visit our [Integration Docs](https://docs.fairblock.network/docs/integration/module-integration). You can also take a look on [Sealed Bid Auction](https://github.com/Fairblock/sealed-bid-auction) for an example app-chain.

If you want to spin up a Fairyring node, see the [Running a node Docs](https://docs.fairblock.network/docs/category/running-a-node).
