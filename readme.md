# Overview 

**fairyring** is a Cosmos SDK blockchain that leverages identity-based encryption (IBE) to enable pre-execution privacy on Cosmos SDK app-chains.
`fairyring` consists of two main components, a blockchain purpose-built for management of decryption keys in a decentralized manner, as well as a Cosmos SDK module that other app-chains can use to integrate with fairyring. 

## Get started

### Compiling & Installing FairyRing chain executable

1. Building fairyring

```bash
make build
```

2. Installing the fairyringd

```bash
make install
```

3. Running fairyringd

```bash
fairyringd
```

### Running the chain with Ignite

```
ignite chain serve
```

Optionally add `rv` tag to reset and have verbose output.

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Running a validator locally with Docker

1. Build docker image

```
docker build -t fairyring .
```

2. Setup validator

```
docker run -it -p 1317:1317 -p 9090:9090 -p 26657:26657 -p 26656:26656 -v ~/.fairyring:/root/.fairyring fairyring setup.sh <moniker>
```

3. Create new genesis.json

```
docker run -it -p 1317:1317 -p 9090:9090 -p 26657:26657 -p 26656:26656 -v ~/.fairyring:/root/.fairyring fairyring fairyringd collect-gentxs
```

4. Start the validator

```
docker run -it -p 1317:1317 -p 9090:9090 -p 26657:26657 -p 26656:26656 -v ~/.fairyring:/root/.fairyring fairyring fairyringd start
```

#### Running multiple validator

1. Repeat step 1 - 2 on all the machines,

2. Run the following command for all the address created in other machine in the master validator:

```
docker run -it -p 1317:1317 -p 9090:9090 -p 26657:26657 -p 26656:26656 -v ~/.fairyring:/root/.fairyring fairyring fairyringd add-genesis-account <address> 100000000stake
```

3. Add all the gentx.json at `~/.fairyring/config/gentx/gentx-{node_id}.json` from all the machines to master validator, then run the command on step 4

4. replace the old `genesis.json` with the new one created in master validator

5. Open config.toml at `~/.fairyring/config/config.toml` on master validator and replace the IP Address & Port of the peers

6. Update the config.toml for all the other machine to include all the validator peers:

```
presistent_peers = "node_id@ip:port,node_id2@ip:port"
```

You can get the node id by the following command:

```
docker run -it -p 1317:1317 -p 9090:9090 -p 26657:26657 -p 26656:26656 -v ~/.fairyring:/root/.fairyring fairyring fairyringd tendermint show-node-id
```

7. Start the validator on all the machines

### Becoming a validator

1. Follow step 1 - 2 on [Run validator locally](#Running-a-validator-locally-with-Docker)

2. Make sure you have enough coins in your account

3. Replace the `genesis.json` and `config.toml`

4. Send the `fairyringd tx staking create-validator` command with the address created to become validator, for example:

```
docker exec -it $(docker ps --latest --format '{{.ID}}') fairyringd tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=100000000stake \
  --pubkey=$(fairyringd tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="choose a moniker" \
  --chain-id="fairyring" \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1000000" \
  --from validator_account
```

5. Start the validator

### Transactions command

#### KeyShare module

Create pub key

```
fairyringd tx keyshare create-latest-pub-key <pub-key-in-hex>
```

Register as a validator

```
fairyringd tx keyshare register-validator
```

Submit a KeyShare

```
fairyringd tx send-key-share <keyshare-in-hex> <commitment-in-hex> <keyshare-index> <keyshare-block-height>
```

#### Pep module

Submit aggregated key share

```
fairyringd tx pep create-aggregated-key-share <aggregated-key-share-height> <aggregated-key-share-in-hex> <public-key-in-hex>
```

Submit encrypted transaction

```
fairyringd tx pep submit-encrypted-tx <encrypted-tx-cipher-in-hex> <target-block-height>
```

### Queries

#### KeyShare module

Get all validators

```
fairyringd query keyshare list-validator-set
```

Get all broadcasted keyshares

```
fairyringd query keyshare list-key-share
```

Get specific validator

```
fairyringd query keyshare show-validator-set <Index>
```

Get specific keyshare

```
fairyringd query keyshare show-key-share <Validator> <BlockHeight>
```

#### Pep module

Get all encrypted tx in state

```
fairyringd query pep list-encrypted-tx
```

Get all encrypted tx in state from a specific block height

```
fairyringd query pep list-encrypted-tx-from-block <blockHeight>
```

Get a single encrypted tx in state with a specific block height & tx index

```
fairyringd query pep show-encrypted-tx <blockHeight> <index>
```

### Sending keyshares every block

It is recommended to run [`fairyringclient`](https://github.com/FairBlock/fairyringclient) so that validator registration and key share submissions are automated.

### Aggregating key shares

It is recommended to run [`fairyport`](https://github.com/FairBlock/fairyport) to listen to broadcast keyshare events and aggregate the keys in each block.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

### Web Frontend

Ignite CLI has scaffolded a Vue.js-based web app in the `vue` directory. Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the app:

```
cd vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

The frontend app is built using the `@starport/vue` and `@starport/vuex` packages. For details, see the [monorepo for Ignite front-end development](https://github.com/ignite/web).


## Setup a testing environment

1. Building the `fairyringd` executable

```bash
make build
```

2. Installing the executable for calling it from terminal

```bash
make install
```

3. Building the executable of [ShareGenerator](https://github.com/FairBlock/ShareGenerator) and [Encrypter](https://github.com/FairBlock/encrypter) and put them in this directory


4. Install [Hermes Relayer](https://hermes.informal.systems/) by following this [guide](https://hermes.informal.systems/quick-start/installation.html)


5. Running the tests 

```bash
make integration-test-all
```
