# Overview

**fairyring** is a Cosmos SDK blockchain that leverages identity-based encryption (IBE) to enable pre-execution privacy on Cosmos SDK app-chains.
`fairyring` consists of two main components, a blockchain purpose-built for management of decryption keys in a decentralized manner, as well as a Cosmos SDK module that other app-chains can use to integrate with fairyring.

## Quick Start

To learn how the Fairyring works from a high-level perspective, see the [Fairyring Basic Docs](https://docs.fairblock.network/docs/learn/overview).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to integrate Fairyring to your own app-chain, visit our [Integration Docs](https://docs.fairblock.network/docs/build/appchain/module-integration). You can also take a look on [Sealed Bid Auction](https://github.com/Fairblock/sealed-bid-auction) for an example app-chain.

If you want to spin up a Fairyring node, see the [Running a node Docs](https://docs.fairblock.network/docs/category/running-a-node).
