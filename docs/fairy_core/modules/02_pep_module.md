# PEP Module

The Pre-Execution Privacy (PEP) module is responsible for accepting encrypted transactions from users, storing them in its state ordered by their target height, accepting aggregated keyshares and finally executing the encrypted transactions at their respective target heights.

Refer to the [PEP Specifications](https://github.com/FairBlock/fairyring/blob/audit/x/pep/specs/01_overview.md) for details on the working of the PEP module.
